# ultimatemysql
MySQL database access wrapper compatible with PHP 8

Based on the excellent work of Jeff Williams
https://www.phpclasses.org/package/3698-PHP-MySQL-database-access-wrapper.html

### Why this repository
Despite it is being used by fortune 500 companies [[source](https://www.phpclasses.org/discuss/package/3698/thread/72/)], the script isn't update since 16/08/2013 (almost 10 years!), so i thinked to create this repository with the aim of making it compatible with PHP 8, and being able to use it for another 10 years (i hope!).

## How to get started
It's a very simple database access wrapper, well documented and safe against SQL injection hacks!

You can start with only 3 lines!

### PHP Library
```php
<?php
include("mysql.class.php");
$db = new MySQL(true, "testdb", "localhost", "root", "password");
$res = $db->QueryArray("SELECT * FROM Test");
?>
```

### Composer package
...OR if you want to include it as a composer package, just type:
```shell
composer require ricci69/ultimatemysql
```
and after use the following PHP code
```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
$db = new MySQL(true, "testdb", "localhost", "root", "password");
$res = $db->QueryArray("SELECT * FROM Test");
?>
```

### Debug mode
The script looks for a file called ```.debugmysql``` (within the root directory or within the composer's vendor / module folder) and, if found, enters debug mode.

When debug mode is active, it writes all SQL queries executed inside the ```.debugmysql``` file.

## How it work and examples
