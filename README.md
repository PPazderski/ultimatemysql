MySQL database access wrapper compatible with PHP 8

## Based on
Based on the excellent work of Jeff Williams
https://www.phpclasses.org/package/3698-PHP-MySQL-database-access-wrapper.html

## Why this repository
Despite it is being used by fortune 500 companies [[source](https://www.phpclasses.org/discuss/package/3698/thread/72/)], the script isn't update since 16/08/2013 (almost 10 years!), so i thinked to create this repository with the aim of making it compatible with PHP 8, and being able to use it for another 10 years (i hope!).
